# Less
Less - Like chess but less

"Less is a simple strategy board game for two or four players.
It's a simple game which can be set up in seconds and the rules can be learned in less than a minute. 
Just take the nine board pieces, place the game pieces and youâ€™re ready to go!
The goal is to move your four pieces to the opponents starting corner before he moves them to yours."

jQuery is also used.


It is still work in progress.
